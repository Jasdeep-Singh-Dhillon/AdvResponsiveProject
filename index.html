              <span class="synopsis">
                Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by
                titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have
                no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to
                do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small
                percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city
                protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest
                of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not
                seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster
                sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are
                destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As
                the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror
                as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder
                every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

                the world for years, killing everyone they see. For the past
                century, what's left of man has hidden in a giant, three-walled
                city. People believe their 50-meter-high walls will protect them
                from the Titans, but the sudden appearance of an immense Titan

                bounded by the Law of Equivalent Exchange: in order to gain
                something, one must sacrifice something of equal value. In an
                alchemical ritual gone wrong, Edward Elric lost his arm and his
                leg, and his brother Alphonse became nothing but a soul in a

                his fame and fortune. They race, along with others, in a

                Everyone faces uncertainty at some point in their lives. Even a
                brilliant surgeon like Kenzo Tenma is no exception. But there’s
                no way he could have known that his decision to stop chasing
                professional success and instead concentrate on his oath to save
                peoples’ lives would result in the birth of an abomination. The
                questions of good and evil now take on a terrifyingly real
                dimension. Years later, in Germany during the tumultuous
                post-reunification period, middle-aged childless couples are
                being killed one after another. The serial killer’s identity is
                known. The reasons why he kills are not. Dr. Tenma sets out on a
                journey to find the killer’s twin sister, who may hold some
                clues to solving the enigma of the “Monster.” (Source: Viz

              <span>
                Sakura High seems like an ordinary school, but its quirky
                students and bizarre clubs make it anything but typical. When
                shy bookworm Haruto gets roped into joining the Paranormal

                learns that life can be unpredictable, but it’s the unexpected
                moments that matter most.

              What a wild ride. How simple really is good vs evil? SPOILER
              WARNING Sure, good vs evil, a trope as old as time. Evil is
              corrupt, it begets more evil. Death, destruction, trauma,
              nihilism. What happens when one person, who is born of evil, and
              molded in the flames, destruction and violence of an orphanage
              that tortured him, is met with the unshakable resilience of one
              Kenzo Tenma, and his belief in one moral code; every life is equal
              and created with inherent meaning.

              The rare and mysterious Puberty Syndrome, believed by many to be a
              myth, is a supernatural condition that only affects teenagers.
              High school student Sakuta Azusagawa, having experienced it
              firsthand, knows it is real and surprisingly common at his school.
              One day, he encounters Mai Sakurajima, a famous former child
              actress now in her third year of high school, who has withdrawn
              from the public eye for unknown reasons. Despite her popularity
              and aloof demeanor, no one seems to notice her wandering the
              library dressed as a bunny girl—except for Sakuta. Realizing she
              is another victim of Puberty Syndrome, Sakuta decides to help Mai
              with her unique predicament, which leads him to cross paths with
              other girls suffering from the mysterious phenomenon.

              After all those years watching anime, it becomes harder to find
              shows that actually surprises and touches you deeply like Violet
              Evergarden was able to do. I've known about this show for quite a
              while now, but only after surpassing the mark of a thousand animes
              whatched, i finally decided to give it a chance, and that made me
              realize how wrong i was for taking so long to see it. That's why i
              decided to make my first ever anime review about it.

            We investigated some strange character favorite counts and
            discovered a bot network of almost 11,000 accounts that created
            around 200,000 invalid favorites across a number of popular
            characters. These favorites have been cleared.
            <br />
            There are most definitely still some botted favorite counts out
            there. We will find you, and we will purge you.
            <br />
            Here are some examples of pre-purge favorite counts: (These counts
            will be fixed automatically once the daily task runs.)

            The issue went away on it's own yesterday without us figuring out
            the cause. We know where the issue is, but not why the issue is.
            <br />
            We will be disabling the API temporarily to see if a reduced load
            solves the problem.
