            <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
            <span class="synopsis">
              Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.

              Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

              I would highly reccomend checking in on the movies above, absolute drama masterpieces, if you like a silent voice, you will also love them.

              And that's it, ive been writing here for 20 minutes now and had a blast just getting my thoughts out into this miracle called "language", man I still wonder how we created it. It's truly magic. Have a great sleep the next time you sleep, take care, don't jump of a balcony just to swap with someone else and bye bye.
