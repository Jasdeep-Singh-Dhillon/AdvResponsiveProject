              This is a story about Momo, a high school girl who comes from a family of spirit mediums, and her classmate Okarun, an occult fanatic. After Momo rescues Okarun from being bullied, they begin talking.

To prove to each other what they believe in is real, Momo goes to an abandoned hospital where a UFO has been spotted and Okarun goes to a tunnel rumored to be haunted. To their surprise, they each encounter overwhelming paranormal activities that transcend comprehension. Amid these predicaments, Momo awakens her hidden power and Okarun gains the power of a curse to overcome these new dangers! Their fateful love begins as well!? The story of the occult battle and adolescence starts!

              I would highly reccomend checking in on the movies above, absolute drama masterpieces, if you like a silent voice, you will also love them.

              And that's it, ive been writing here for 20 minutes now and had a blast just getting my thoughts out into this miracle called "language", man I still wonder how we created it. It's truly magic. Have a great sleep the next time you sleep, take care, don't jump of a balcony just to swap with someone else and bye bye.
